Access modifiers control who has access to :
	Classes
	Attributes
	Methods
	Constructors
	
There are 4 types of access modifiers:

1. private : can be used on 
			-Attributes
			-Methods
			-Constructors
		- It cannot be used on Classes.
		  Because if you make your class private then nobody can access it.
        - It only allows visibility within the class.

2. default : can be used on 
			-Classes
			-Attributes
			-Methods
			-Constructors
		-  It is also known as package access modifier
           Because it only allows visibility within the same package.
           
3. protected : can be used on 
			-Attributes
			-Methods
   		- It cannot be used on Classes and Constructors.
        - Same as default, but the members have visibility from
          another package through Inheritance.
 
4. public : can be used on
			-Classes 
			-Attributes
			-Methods
			-Constructors			
		 - It allows visibility within anywhere the project.
